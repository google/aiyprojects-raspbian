## Newly added functions

## Overview

This repository contains an easy-to-use API for the [AIY Vision Kit][aiy-vision]
and [AIY Voice Kit][aiy-voice]. Have a look at [example code][aiy-github-examples]
to see how both kits can be used. Comprehensive documentation is at the
[AIY Projects Site][aiy-site].

If you're using Raspbian instead of Google's provided image, read
[HACKING.md] for information on getting started.

For returning users. The code for all AIY kits is in the `aiyprojects` branch,
and is included in images starting with `aiyprojects-2017-12-18.img`.
The previous `voicekit` branch contains code just for the Voice Kit, and the
`master` branch contains the original deprecated `Voice Recognizer` demo.
