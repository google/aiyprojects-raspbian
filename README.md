This repository contains an easy-to-use API for the AIY Voice Kit.
You can use it to create voice commands with simple while loops - have a look at the [demos](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/tree/voicekit/src).
Documentation is at the [AIY Projects site](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com).

For guidelines on contributing, look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For returning users:
The old voice-recognizer demo remains in the [master branch](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/tree/master) of this project.
The new code is in the `voicekit` branch, and is included in images starting with aiyprojects-2017-09-11.img.
