This repository contains an easy-to-use API for the AIY Voice Kit.
You can use it to create voice commands with simple while loops - have a look at the demos[https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/tree/voicekit/src].
Documentation is at the [AIY Projects site](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com).
For guidelines on contributing, look at CONTRIBUTING.md.
