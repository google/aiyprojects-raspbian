# AIY Projects

This repository contains an easy-to-use Python API for the [AIY Vision Kit][aiy-vision]
and [AIY Voice Kit][aiy-voice]. The code for all AIY kits is in the `aiyprojects` branch,
and is included in images starting with `aiyprojects-2017-12-18.img`.
The previous `voicekit` branch contains code just for the Voice Kit, and the
`master` branch contains the original deprecated `Voice Recognizer` demo.

## Documentation

If you're just getting started with the Vision or Voice kit, see the
assembly guide and other maker guides at [aiyprojects.withgoogle.com].

If you just need the Python API reference, see [aiyprojects.readthedocs.io].
Also have a look at the [example code][aiy-github-examples].

If you want to flash the latest AIY system image or install AIY packages on an existing
Raspbian system, read the [system updates guide][HACKING.md].
