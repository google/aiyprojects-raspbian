"""Activates the Google Assistant with hotword detection, using the Google Assistant Library.

The Google Assistant Library has direct access to the audio API, so this Python
code doesn't need to record audio.

.. note:

    This example depends on hotword detection (such as "Okay Google") to activate the Google
    Assistant, which is supported only with Raspberry Pi 2/3. If you're using a Pi Zero, this
    code won't work. Instead, you must use the button or another type of trigger, as shown
    in assistant_library_with_button_demo.py.
