Simple piezo buzzer controller for the pwm-soft driver.

This is designed to both expose the raw controller so that the user can adjust
frequency, period, and pulse width, and also provide a simple means for playing
melodic sounds.

    Simple usage:
        from aiy._drivers._buzzer import PWMController
        with PWMController(gpio=22) as controller:
            controller.set_frequency(440.00)

            controller.set_frequency(0)

    Note: The pwm-soft driver is a little cantankerous and weird in terms of the
    model that it uses for controlling the PWM output. Instead of specifying a
    period and a duty cycle percentage, this driver explicitly allows the user
    to specify how long in microseconds to keep the GPIO high, and how long the
    entire period is.

    This can make things a little strange when it comes to changing the
    apparent frequency of the PWM output, as simply adjusting the period time
    while leaving the pulse time constant will produce phasing effects rather
    than frequency shifts.

    For more melodious uses, set_frequency should be enough.
