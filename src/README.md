This repository contains an easy-to-use API for the AIY Vision Kit and
AIY Voice Kit.
You can use it for face detection and object recognition, or use it to create
voice commands with simple while loops - have a look at the
[demos](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/tree/aiyprojects/src/examples).

Documentation is at the [AIY Projects site](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com).

For guidelines on contributing, look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
If you're using Raspbian instead of Google's provided image, read
[HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for information on getting started.
